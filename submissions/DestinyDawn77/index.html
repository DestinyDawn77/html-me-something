        <h3> My Journey Begins in Elementary School (1980's) </h3>
        <p>In the early 1980's, around 2nd grade for me, I was first introduced to the Apple II GE computer.  For a second grader, I was amazed and excited!
           Over the course of the next 4 years, my family acquired a Commodore 64.  I immediately started to play around with some basic "coding" on both systems, and <body>
           the 6th grade, was proud to present my first programs.  On the Apple, I had created a visual program, which dispayed a house with moving clouds and a moving smoke stream coming from the chimney.
           Elementary I know, but for an elementary school student, this was a <b>BIG</b> accomplishment!  On the Commodore, I managed to create a very simple game of "Pong", a game involving one paddle at the
           bottom of the screen, which bounced a small ball around. </P>

          <h3> My First Programming Class!</h3>
            <p> My Senior Year of Highschool, I had decided upon the Engineering track, and started courses at our local Community College, as part of a dual=enrollment program.  My first class was in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN.<a/>
                At this time, compilers should have been a four-letter word!  We wrote our code on lined paper, submitted the code to our professor for some basic structural review, and finally entered up to 100
                lines of code into a compiler... hoping and <b> PRAYING </b> it would work.  Nine times out of ten, we received the dreaded "compilation failed" message.  There was no "looking for a semi-colon here"
                or even a "Hey!  Your error is on this line!", simply an error message.  100 lines of code and a simple missing semi-colon could be the culprit!
                As much as I enjoyed the logic and the assembly of programming, those people were CRAZY! I chose to stick with my logic puzzles instead.

          <h3> But I want to MAKE stuff!!! </h3>
            <p> Looking back on my early years of college, I only wish someone had mentioned the words "Computer Engineering".  WIthin a few years, I had decided Electrical Engineers didn't make the stuff
              I wanted to make.  Circuits?  Wonderful!  Dynamics, properties of every man-made substance?  Not my cup of tea.  Disheartened by the lack of "Making Stuff", my degree changed to Graphic Design.  Why Graphic Design?
              I got to MAKE STUFF on the computer!  Unfortunately, the Graphic Design industry took a massive downturn about 5 years out of college, following <a href = "http://www.history.com/topics/9-11-attacks">9-11. <a/></p>

          <h3> Embrace your Inner-NERD!</h3>
      <p>
        The one thing I remind my children of regularly is that "nerds rule the world!".  YES!  I am a nerd!  It took me until my mid thirties to finally admit it.  In Highschool, I did everything I could to hide
        who I really was.  Why?  Being a nerd wasn't cool.  It took a silly, highly addictive video game to bring me out of my shell.  About 6 years ago, I stumbled upon a game advertised on facebook called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_Ultima">"Lord of Altima".<a/>
        This low-graphics, but highly strategic game attracts nerds of all kinds.  I quickly developed friendships with many IT professionals, programmers, web developers, etc.  As I heard countless tales of their professional
        lives, I realized more and more that my continued love for computers and specifically programming could atually turn into a rewarding career!  With their encouragement, I returned to school to seek a degree in
        Computer Engineering.  One of my "gaming friends" even offered to mentor me, which he has done for years now.   I am 20 credits away from my Associate of Arts degree, with plans to transfer to Washington University to persue my
        Bachelor's.

        One morning in early May, as I was preparing lunches for the kids, I heard a quick mention on the news about this company called "LaunchCode Saint Louis" and their <a href = "https://www.launchcode.org/summerofcode">"Summer of Code"<a/> program.  I dropped the utensiles and came
        SCREAMING into the living room.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing!  A program teaching JUST code?  Job Placement?  No WAY!  And here I AM!
